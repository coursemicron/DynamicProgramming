Say that you are a traveller in a 2d grid. Your starting position is always top left hand corner grid.
Your goal is to reach bottom right corner grid.

So in how many steps you can reach from starting to end position ?

Example:

In below grid from S to E you have to take 3 steps

-------------------------
|   S   |       |       |
-------------------------
|       |       |   E   |
-------------------------
